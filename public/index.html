<h1>Best movies according to Tania</h1>
<p> <h2> My Top 3 movies</h2></p><hr />

<p><h3> Pride and prejudice 2005</h3></p>
<p>The 2005 version is definitely my favourite version of the classic novel.<br/> Great interpretation and gorgeous visuals.</p>

<p><h3>Fantastic Beasts and where to find them</h3></p>
<p>If you are a  J.K. Rowling fan  you ought to love this.</p>

<p><h3>the Marvel series</h3></p>
<p>It was a fun ride to follow the individual stories of each caracter <br /> and the entire world building. <br />GOOD SOUP!!!</p>
<p><h4>P.S. I cannot for the love of me remember what I've watched in the last decade ...<br /> Sooo.. we will leave it at that  </h4></p>
